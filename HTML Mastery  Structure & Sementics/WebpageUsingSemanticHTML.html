            <h1>Champions Trophy | SA, Kiwis chase a shot at glory</h1>
            <p>
                Though both South Africa and New Zealand won the ICC Knockouts, as the Champions Trophy was known earlier, it has been 25 years since either of them have been able to win a global white-ball title.

                So, when they meet at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday in a semifinals clash, both stand a chance of inching closer to making history. But as Mitchell Santner, the New Zealand captain, points out, “it’s one at a time.”
                
                Since the last edition of the Champions Trophy, in 2017, New Zealand and South Africa have faced each other just thrice in ODIs, and even though they play against each other for the first time at the iconic venue, the Kiwis have an advantage as they come on the back of a six-match winning streak in the country.
                
                But South Africa, which over the years, has earned the ‘choker’s’ tag for fumbling in major events, is under no pressure, and as captain Temba Bavuma says, “We’ll approach it as we normally would.”
